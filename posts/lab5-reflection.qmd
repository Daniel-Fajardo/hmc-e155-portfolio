This lab was a fun one. Having access to SEGGER's CMSIS files made referencing the datasheet so much easier. The ability to trust that
the register addresses were correct without constantly checking the reference manual allowed for much quicker debugging. I also found
that I was able to grasp the concept of interrupts fairly quickly. I also found that after struggling through lab 4, my process for
debugging greatly improved. Overall this lab gave me the needed confidence boost and inspiration to continue working on the final two
labs.
