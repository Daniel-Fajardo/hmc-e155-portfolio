This lab again expanded upon the previous two labs by adding a keypad scanner to the existing multiplexed 7-segment display. The keypad
contains each hexadecimal digit and upon button press, the 7-segment displays will record the most recent two inputs. The keypad will
only record one button push at a time and will hold the value of the first button pressed if multiple are pressed simultaneously.

This lab was very intellectually challenging for me. The process of understanding how the fsm should function took some time and then 
figuring out how to approach it was more difficult. Once I had a solid grasp, I was able to get the design to work well in simulation in
little time. The speed of development was thanks to implementing testbenches in QuestaSim for the first time in this class, which
allowed for quick debugging.

The frustrating part of this lab came in trying to transfer a design that was working perfectly in simulation into a design that works
in hardware. My first issue came in synthesizing the design in Lattice Radiant. I had inferred a number of latches by not defining each
output in each state in my fsm. By splitting my fsm into multiple fsms in the same module (one for state, nextstate, and others for
outputs), I solved this issue. The next issue came from the button push not registering correctly. In simulation, a button input would
hold the column high, but this was not happening in hardware. I am still working on resolving this issue.
