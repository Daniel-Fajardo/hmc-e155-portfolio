# Introduction

This lab expanded on the previous lab by adding a second 7-segment digit display to the FPGA design. Instead of adding FPGA I/O pins to
the design, the two displays were accessed via a multiplexer which oscillated at a rate just fast enough to give the illusion of them
both being on at the same time. This lab also implemented transistors to turn on/off each display.

# Design and Testing Methodology

The System Verilog in this lab was much more modular than in the previous lab.
