# Introduction

This lab expanded on the previous lab by adding a second 7-segment digit display to the FPGA design. Instead of adding FPGA I/O pins to
the design, the two displays were accessed via a multiplexer which oscillated at a rate just fast enough to give the illusion of them
both being on at the same time. This lab also implemented transistors to turn on/off each display.

# Design and Testing Methodology

The System Verilog in this lab was much more modular than in the previous lab. This lab resused the clock divider and 7-segment logic 
modules. This time the clock divider was adjusted to output clk at a frequency just above 90 Hz (this is the frequency at which humans
are able to register) so that the two displays would appear on at the same time. At each positive edge of the clock, the chooseanode
module would alternate which display would receive current to its anode. The current to each display was controlled via a transistor.
The chooseanode module would also operate a mux (separate module) to select which of the two 4-bit inputs would be active and the
chosen input would be sent to the 7-segment logic module, which would output the corresponding digit display. Finally, a module called
leds would act as a full adder for the two inputs and would output the 5-bit sum on external leds.

# Block Diagram

The block diagram in Figure 1 demonstrates the overall architecture of the design. The clock divider module utilizes the on-board high
speed oscillator (HSOSC) from the iCE40 library and outputs the clock to be used for the choose anode module. The other two submodules
are the segment logic and the leds module.

# Schematic

The schematic in Figure 2 shows the layout of the circuitry. The FPGA board is shown on the left with internal pull up resistors for the
inputs and outputs. The inputs include the on-board 4-pin dip switch and an external 4-pin dip switch. The outputs include the leds,
which are current limited by resistors, the segment display signals, which are connected in parallel, and finally the transistors, which
have the 3.3V connected to the collector pins and a resistor connected to the base, while the emitter is hooked up to the display anodes.

# Results and Discussion

![Figure 3: Testbench simulation](images\Lab2 Testbench.jpg)

The design was mostly successful. In simulation (Figure 3), the selected anode would correclty alternate on the rising edge of the clock,
as would the output segment logic alternate between s1 and s2. The led adder logic also produced the expected outputs. The 7-segment
logic continued to work, as it did in the previous lab. With all this, the top level module worked successfully, outputting the correct
7-segment and led logic at an alternating times.

In hardware, the design is fully successful only a fraction of the time. A large reason for this is poor solder joints which lead to
incosistent pinouts. Another shortcoming is the current draw to some of the pins. This lab requires a large amount of current draw to
handle all of its desired outputs. The 7-segment leds are not getting quite enough current and this is likely due to a large current pull
elsewhere. I hope to adress each of these issues in the coming weeks, so that the design can perform more consistently, although when it
does work it is reliably.

# Conclusion

The design semiconsistently displays two digits using a mux to alternate between the displays at a frequency higher than the human eye
can perceive. The design operates successfully at the will of the solder joint connections and with inconsistent current draw to each
led. This lab took me roughly 20 hours to complete.
