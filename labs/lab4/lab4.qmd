# Introduction

This was the first lab built entirely on the STM32 microcontroller. The system is capable of playing music on an 8-ohm speaker after
amplification by an LM386 audio amplifier. The design contains a library written from scratch that configures the clock for PWM output.
The MCU then reads a list of notes specifying the pitch (in Hz) and durations in (ms) for each note and plays each note for the its
tupled duration.

# Design and Testing Methodology

This lab included writing a header file from scratch to configure timers 15 and 16 from the STM32L432KC reference manual. Before this
can be done the clock needs to be configured.
