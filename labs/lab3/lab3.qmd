# Introduction

This lab again expanded upon the previous two labs by adding a keypad scanner to the existing multiplexed 7-segment display. The keypad
contains each hexadecimal digit and upon button press, the 7-segment displays will record the most recent two inputs. The keypad will
only record one button push at a time and will hold the value of the first button pressed if multiple are pressed simultaneously.
