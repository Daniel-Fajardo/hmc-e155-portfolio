Daniel Fajardo is an engineering major at [Harvey Mudd College](https://hmc.edu). He is interested in pursuing a career in both
electrical and mechanical engineering with a focus on areas that intersect both fields, such as mechatronics and systems engineering.
His specific interests include embedded systems and microcontrollers, mechanical motion dynamics, and electrical design, which can be
used to develop hardware and software solutions for automation and control systems. He also has a concentration in psychology and applies
an interdisciplinary approach to solving engineering problems with environmental and human centered design considerations.
He is also a member of the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps cross country team, receiving all-region awards and national all-academic honors.
