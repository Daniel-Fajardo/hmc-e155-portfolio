    "text": "Lab Reflection:\nThis weeks lab was focused on setting up and testing the FPGA and MCU boards that will be used for the rest of the course. This lab involved soldering all the necessary components onto the e-155 protoboard, downloading the software interfaces: Lattice Radiant and SEGGER Embedded Studio, as well as the simulation software: ModelSim. Demo code was provided to verify that each software and hardware component was functioning correctly. Finally, the design part of the lab was to provide a 7 segment led digit display which corresponds to its binary input on the protoboard. This design was both simulated and verified with test vectors in ModelSim and was implemented with Lattice Radiant.\nThe most difficult part of this lab by far was debugging each software application so that it would correctly upload to the fpga and mcu. The challenges lied in assuring that I had the correct software installed with the correct licenses and the correct hardware drivers. On my personal device, I struggled to get Lattice Radiant to synthesize the FPGA and getting SEGGER to drive the MCU remains unresolved. Because of these struggles, I had to complete the lab using the computers in HMCâ€™s digital lab.\nOnce the software and hardware appeared to be working enough to get started, I found the verilog module design to be fairly straight forward. Calculating the combinational logic for the 7-segment display was the most labor intensive part of the process for me and writing the HDL was quite simple. There was minimal debugging of the code, as the majority of the debugging came from understanding how Lattice Radiant works.\nThis lab also challenged my orginizational skills. This was the first project I have organized using github and learning the nuances took some time."
